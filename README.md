# Heuristic-Based Job Scheduler for Cloud Computing

## Project Overview
This project develops a heuristic-based job scheduler designed to optimize the allocation of cloud computing resources. The scheduler aims to minimize the total execution time and maximize resource utilization across various tasks, significantly improving performance in cloud environments. This is just a testing of my learning in combinatorial optimization, and I will be testing bunch of heuristic algorithms here.

## Objectives
- Develop and implement heuristic algorithms to allocate resources efficiently.
- Minimize the makespan of all jobs in the cloud environment.
- Maximize the utilization of cloud resources to reduce operational costs.
- Simulate different scheduling strategies to evaluate performance.

## Algorithms Tested
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language used.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For handling data and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For generating visualizations of the scheduler's performance.
- **SimPy**: For simulating the cloud computing environment.

## Getting Started
